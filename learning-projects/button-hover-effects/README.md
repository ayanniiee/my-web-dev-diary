# 🎀 Button Hover Effects

This project is part of my **Web Dev Quests** learning path.
The goal was to practice the **CSS Box Model** and create buttons that react to hover using the tools I’ve learned so far:

✨ **width, margin, padding, border, border-radius, and hover states** ✨

---

## 🎯 Goals

* 📦 Apply **box model concepts**: width, padding, margin, border, border-radius
* 🎨 Experiment with **hover states** (`:hover`, `:active`)
* ⏳ Use **transitions** to make hover effects smooth
* ➗ Practice **CSS math** with `calc()` to fit six buttons in one row
* 🌸 Add creativity with **colors, shadows, and gradients**

---

## 🪄 What I Built

* 🌼 **Default** → plain box, no rounding
* ✨ **Glow** → glowing shadow + rounded corners
* ☁️ **Raised** → lifts on hover, presses in on click
* 🎀 **Outline** → dotted outline, inverts colors on hover
* 🔍 **Zoom** → scales up smoothly on hover
* 🌈 **Gradient** → pastel gradient background that shifts on hover

## 📦 Box Model Practice



💡 note to self

```css
width: calc((100% - 12%) / 6 - 2em);
```

* `12%` = total margin across 6 buttons (`margin: 0 1%`)
* `2em` = total horizontal padding (1em left + 1em right)
